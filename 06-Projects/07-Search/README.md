## Projects

If your frontend could use some work, now is the time to give it the love and attention it deserves.

#### Frontend

- Look back on the frontend feedbacks from your intermediate demo, and implement them.
- Call in some extra support if needed, and get a TA to give you additional feedback on ways to improve.
- Go to your favorite apps & websites and pay attention to the small details they use to elevate their design... and then steal like an artist (can you say 'browser inspector'?) and implement it in your own design.
- If it's a mobile app, make sure you're checking often that everything is looking good and is in it's correct place on the mobile browser.
