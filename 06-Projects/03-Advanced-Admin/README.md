## Projects - Day Three

Day three - keep up the good work!

**Domain name**

If your team hasn't set up a custom domain yet, do that first thing. You can check the previous days instructions to follow the correct guide. Otherwise, confirm that the domain is connected correctly and fill in the info on [your product page]().

**Debug Heroku**

A lot of progress was likely made on the previous day. If you haven't pushed all that new merged code to Heroku yet, now is the time. Once it's there, test all the features and prioritize fixing any bugs first.

**Seeds**

If you don't have any seeds yet, create some. If you already have some, think about how you can improve them and bulk them out. The more seeds you have and the better they are, the more legit your app will look.

**Homepage**

The landing page is the first page your user will see. Spend time making this look really nice! Imagine a brand new user coming to your site for the first time -- they should be able to figure out what the general idea of your app is about just by reading the landing page. Make sure to include clear, descriptive images and text here.

**Partials**
