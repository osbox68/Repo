## Projects - Day Five

Today is your intermediate demo! This is an exciting day, as it's the only time before Demo Day that you'll see what all the other teams have been working on. After today, the pitch practices will happen 1:1 with your team and some selected teachers/TAs. So it's time to show off all the hard work you've put in the last 4 days!

You know the drill:
- **Midday: Stop coding any new features**
- Push your branches
- Solve conflicts
- Debug
- Merge branches
- Push to Heroku
- Debug again :)
- Prepare your pitch
- End of day: Demo time!

### Demos

What makes a good demo?
- 5 minutes per product
- 1-2 speakers, 1 assistant (if non-remote)
- No demos on localhost, demos must take place on production environments
- Embody a use case, starting from your pain - do not describe the features you coded. Instead, pretend like this is the first you're seeing this app.
- Have realistic data on your website
- Practice, practice, practice!

Get some inspiration on how to prepare your own demo by familiarising yourself with previous projects. This is a super useful way to understand what makes a good user journey and pitch. There are many, many, many available to watch online.
