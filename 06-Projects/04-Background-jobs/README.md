## Projects - Day Four

The next day will be your **intermediate demo**!

At this point, your **core user journey** should essentially be complete. If it's not, this should be the main focus for today. Put aside any features that are not a part of the core user journey, and come back to them once these most important features are complete.

If the majority of your backend is working and you haven't pimped out your seeds yet, now is the time. Having plenty of well-thought-out, realistic data in your app will make it seem that much more legit. Using a gem like faker is great, creating them all from scratch is even better but can be pretty time-consuming -- have you thought about using an API? There's pretty much an API for everything at this point, try searching google to check if there's an API dataset that would fit your use-case. Then you can use [this lecture code](https://kitt.lewagon.com/karr/karr.kitt/lectures/rails/search-6/index.html?title=Search&program_id=1#/1/3) as a reference for how to import and use the data to create instances of your models in your seeds file.
