## Projects - Demo Day

It's finally the day we've all been waiting for!

Today there should be **no coding** -- unless there's a last minute fire to put out of course 😉

Instead, today should only be about the following:
- Rehearse
- Rehearse again
- Rehearse one last time, for old times sake
- Relax and enjoy your final day of this wild ride

Congratulations on making it to the end! You and your team have built something amazing and you should be very proud. Good luck and have fun! 🎉🎉🎉
