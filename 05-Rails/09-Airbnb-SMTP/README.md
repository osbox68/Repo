### Searching

Today we learned multiple different ways to implement a search function in a rails app. Time to take that logic and add it to your own app!

Before doing this though, it's good to consider the use case of the search form - does your user need to be able to search through multiple columns, or just one? Do you want to be able to filter by certain categories? Depending on what you choose, your search form can potentially get rather complicated. Keep in mind that users are inherently lazy, and even if you give them lots of different ways to search, they will likely only use one of them ðŸ˜‰
