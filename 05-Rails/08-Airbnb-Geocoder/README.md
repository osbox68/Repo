## AirBnB - Intermediate Demos

Tonight is your **intermediate demo** ðŸ˜±

The schedule is a bit different than the previous sessions:

- **After the break: Stop coding any new features**
- Push your branches
- Solve conflicts
- Debug
- Merge branches
- Push to Heroku
- Debug again ðŸ˜…
- Prepare your pitch
- Demo time!


## Mapbox

Time to add a map to your application!

One of the quintessential features of AirBnB is that map (we all know the one). Make sure to follow the setup from lecture **slowly and closely** in order to get your geocoding and map implemented correctly.

As the Javscript module probably feels like forever ago, it would be a good idea to refresh your memory by checking out the lecture slides again, and in particular [the Javascript Plugins lecture](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/lectures/04-Front-End%2F07-JavaScript-Plugins). This lecture goes over the following very important concepts in Javascript:
- separation of concerns, i.e. writing your functions in different files
- and then exporting /importing those functions in the correct files

Finally, when you're working with Javascript, the error messages aren't displayed the way Rails error messages are. This means it can be hard to understand why something isn't working when it's supposed to ðŸ¤”, as you don't get the same visual feedback. Whenever this is the case, you'll have to actively go check for the errors in the browser: open up your browser inspector and navigate to the `console` tab. There you'll find any error messages related to your Javascript code.
