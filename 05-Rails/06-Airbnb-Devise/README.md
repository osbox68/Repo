## AirBnB Kickoff

You will spend the next sessions with your Project Group working on an Airbnb clone (you don't have to rent **flats**, be creative!)

#### Demos

You will demo your work (in production, no demos on `localhost`!) during the **Geocoding** and **AJAX in Rails** sessions. Deadlines matter!

#### Kickoff
The kick off will be broken up into two parts:
- Part 1 involves all the brainstorming discussions prior to coding (user stories, DB, routes etc.)
- Part 2 entails setting up your app and project management tools in order to start coding

For **each step of part 1**, you must put in a ticket to get it validated by a TA before proceeding.

## Part 1

####  Step 1 - User stories

Duplicate this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_q-wwWiWUY5VL0gZVtqWIidWEtfwhX8FHEbwaW0LuFI/edit?usp=sharing) (1 per team) and invite your teammates to collaborate.

Start by thinking of the **user journeys** you will showcase during the demo. There are lots of possible use cases for a product like Airbnb, but try to narrow them down to the minimum viable user journeys to make it work.

<details><summary markdown='span'>View a possible solution
</summary>

- 1 user journey for the user creating an offer
- 1 user journey for the user booking an offer
- 1 user journey for the owner accepting or declining a booking request

</details>

Each user journey contains several **user stories**: write them down in the spreadsheet by using the right terminology.

When coming up with your user stories with your team, we recommend to organize them with the MoSCoW method:
- üìó **Must have**: critical in order for it to be a success
- üìí **Should have**: important but not necessary for delivery in the current timebox
- üìô **Could have**: desirable but not necessary
- üìï **Won‚Äôt have**: the least-critical, lowest-payback items, or not appropriate

By thinking of your user stories this way, it will make it easier to label and prioritize them in your Kanban board.

When you are done, create a ticket to validate them with a teacher.

#### Step 2 - Database Scheme

Based on the user stories, draw your database schema using [our db tool](https://kitt.lewagon.com/db/new). Draw only the minimum viable for your app to work - you should have only 3 tables. Make sure to use the right conventions (plural names for tables, singular for columns, etc).

When you think you're done or you're stuck and need help, create a ticket to validate it with a teacher.


#### Step 3 - Routes & Mockups

Based on your user stories, figure out the **routes** for each and add them to your spreadsheet, along with the corresponding **controller** and **action**.

Time to draw quick sketches of the different screens and the rough elements they contain. This will help you visualize your user journeys. You can use pen & paper if you want to, or you can use a tool like [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com) or [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to keep it digital & easy. Be careful, no need to be too specific at this point! This is a sprint, you need to allocate your time and resources wisely.

Create a ticket to validate them with a teacher. All good? Time for Part 2!

## Part 2

As not everyone will be able to code the app setup, now is the perfect time to divide up the rest of the steps amongst your team so that everyone has something to work on.

Before splitting the tasks among the team, set your project up together. The **lead developer** (and only him/her) should:

#### Task 1 - Rails new

First, decide amongst your team who will be the Lead Developer for this project. This just means that the person is the Github and Heroku repository owner. That person will then continue with the following steps for setting up the app.

First up, let's create the Rails project with a Postgres config. We will use Le Wagon's minimal template, which already has a good frontend setup:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
rails new \
  --database postgresql \
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/rails-templates/master/minimal.rb \
  CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_RAILS_APP_NAME
```

Again, only the **lead developer** will do this! Not everyone in the team...

Next up, push the project on Github

```bash
cd rails-airbnb-clone
gh repo create
git push origin master
```

Then, we need to give your teammates push access to the repo. Go to [your Github repo settings](https://github.com/<user.github_nickname>/rails-airbnb-clone/settings/collaboration) and add your teammates as **collaborators**.

The other teammates can now **clone** the project. ‚ö†Ô∏è**Be careful, use `SSH` url**‚ö†Ô∏è

Then, the teammates should run:

```bash
bundle install
yarn install
rails db:create db:migrate
```

After that's done, it's time to set up and push to Heroku. Even if it's just a skeleton app, it's important to deploy on Heroku **from day one**, and then continuously deploy every day with each new feature.

```bash
heroku create airbnb-<user.lower_github_nickname> --region=REPLACE_WITH_REGION # (eu, us, or any region available in `heroku regions` list)
git push heroku master
heroku run rails db:migrate
```


From this point you can start splitting the tasks. **Spend time on the setup, because everything will be simpler if you do it correctly at the beginning**.

#### Kick-off

When trying to split work in your team, you'll realize that many tasks depend on other ones... How to integrate facebook connect if there is no `User` model? How to implement bookings if there is no `Flat` model? Here are some guidelines to help you organize your work:

You must always start with the **core models** in your app that all future features will depend on. In Airbnb's case, they are clearly `User` and `Flat`. Once these models are integrated, it becomes easier to split work on remaining features. As a kick-off phase, you can therefore separate two main tasks:

**group #1 - Model kick-start**:
- Integrate `User` with Devise signin/signup
- Integrate `Flat` with listing (`index`) and creation (`new/create`)

**group #2 - Frontend kick-start**:
- Work on a clean layout with navbar/footer
- Build a simple, attractive home page.

Once both groups are done (it should take you ~2h each) and once you have all merged your work on Github, you can move on and split tasks for the remaining features.


#### Tasks organization

Here is a list of different user stories to implement on the Airbnb project:

- As a user, I can navigate on the website from the navbar (with functional links, e.g. "signin/signout", "My bookings", "Publish an offer", etc.)
- As a user, I can view a flat's page
- As a user, I can book a flat
- As a user, I can add pictures for my flat
- As a user, I can add reviews for a flat I've stayed in
- As a user, I can locate flats on a map
- As a user, I can log in with Facebook
- As a user, I can receive an email when someone books my flat
- ...

**Some of these features are more important than others**. It's your role to prioritize them to get an MVP at the end of the week!

#### Feature example: Book a flat

When you work on a feature, work on it **conscientiously from the database to the HTML/CSS**. Let's take the example of the "booking" feature:

*Model*
- I will create a `Booking` model and its associated migration.
- Then I will write a working model with associations and validations.
- I will then crash-test my model from the `rails console` to make sure everything in the model works.

*Routing*:
- I will add bookings routes in `routes.rb`

*Controller*:
- I will create a new `BookingsController` with the `create` and `index` actions.
- I will implement these two actions.

*Views modification*:
- I will embed the booking form in the existing `views/flats/show.html.erb`
- I will list all current user's bookings on a new page `views/bookings/index.html.erb`.

*Links*:
- I will add a link to the `bookings#index`page in the navbar.

*HTML/CSS*:
- My booking form is clean with the correct Bootstrap classes for the inputs and buttons.
- My new bookings page is clean with a `container` to center the content, clear headers, and a clean design for each booking.
- I will take time to refactor my HTML using partials if my HTML code is too long and hard to read.

**Code it perfectly, from model to view**

- Crash test all your model associations and validations in the rails console.
- Don't neglect the view. If you add a form, make it a nice, centered and responsive Bootstrap form. If you code a flats list, build a nice Bootstrap grid (for example, with flat picture on the left and flat info on the right..).
- Use partials to refactor your HTML and make it more readable and maintainable.
