## Core User Journey

Now that you have a clear product pitch and that you share the same vision, it's time to define **your product core user journey**.

The core user journey is **the main task** a user will do on your app to achieve his/her goal. This is the most important task on you app, and this is the one you will present this evening.

A user journey represent **all the steps** a user will do to complete a task.

In modern web applications, several tasks can be done by users. Some of this tasks are commons and other are specific to each product. The **common ones shouldn't be included in a prototype** as they don't add any value to your product (like sign up, complete user profile, etc.).

Here your need to focus on the specifics tasks of your product and choose the journey which directly answer to the **need you want to fulfill**.

Keep in mind that building a user journey is part of what product designers call **User Research**.

We don't want to focus on the product interface here, but more on **each actions the user will do** to achieve his/her goal. Your work here is to describe precisely each steps of your core user journey by following this rules:

- Each steps should describe an **user action**
- **Keep steps short:** If you express a step shortly is maybe because you need to divide it in 2 steps.
- **Use human words:** we are not focusing on the interface, so avoid words like `click`, `scroll`, `swipe`, `toggle`, etc. and prefer words like `see`, `choose`, `go`, etc.
- **Action should be concrete**: avoid vagueness action description like `The user search a restaurant` (how does he/she search? By name, by adresse, by rate, etc?)

The final result should look like a little **scenario of 10 to 15 steps**.

When it's done, take the time to call a teacher to validate your core user journey.
