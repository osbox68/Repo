## Wireframe (1h)

It's time to take back your User Flow and to create your wireframe with the help of your UI Kit. The goal here is to create a lo fi mock-up for each screen of your product.

Start by create a new page on your Figma file and add a new frame on it. You can draw a rectangle on your new frame and center it in order to put margins on both side of your frame:

When it's done, you can simply duplicate this new frame by copy/pasting it. This way, each new frame will keep the same margins. Create as much frame than you have screen on your User Flow.

> **Be careful here** : it's very important that you **create a frame for each screen** of your app. If you're not sure that your setup is correct, please call a teacher to validate it.

When all the screens are created, each member of your team can take care of a screen (you can also work by groups of 2).

### Use Figma's Grid feature
