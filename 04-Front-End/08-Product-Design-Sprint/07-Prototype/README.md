## Prototype (15mn)

Time to turn your wireframe into a functionnal prototype. At this point, all your screens should be finished. Don't start this step if you haven't finish creating all the screen.

To connect each screens, go into the `Prototype` tab of the right panel. Then you just have to connect each button to the screen you to go to when clicking on it. Here is an example of doing it:

When it's done, you can simply launch the demo mode and try to click on the button linked to a screen to preview a live demo of your application.
