## What you will build today

We will not code today, but that doesn't mean you'll not build anything.
Today we will use new tools to build a **black and white prototype** of your project.

### Stake of the day

Don't loose the big picture of the day. The goal today is to:

- **Scope** your product
- Identify your **Core User Journey**
- Build a **lo-fi prototype** in order to test your journey

### Schedule of the day

Here is the schedule of your day:

1. Defining your **Product Pitch** (~30mn)
1. Find your **Core User Journey** (~30mn)
1. Sketch you **User Flow** (~15mn)
1. Create a **Basic UI Kit** (~30mn)
1. Add **advanced components** to your UI Kitt (~30mn)
1. Create a **Wireframe** (~1h)
1. Turn your wireframe into a **Prototype** (~15mn)
1. **Prepare your pitch** (all the remaining time)

The timing is tight so don't get too long to get started and try to respect the duration indicated. You should at least have **finished your Basic UI Kit before lunch**.

It's a very important day as it's the Kickoff of the app you will build during the last 2 weeks of the bootcamp. Each step are important, that's why **you should validate each one with a TA**.

Good luck!
