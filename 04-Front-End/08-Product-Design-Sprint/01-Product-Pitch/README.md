## Product pitch

Idea pitched on monday evening.

The goal of the product pitch is to sharpen your project idea, to define a specific scope and to have clear vision of what you are going to build.

In order to do that you need to define:
- The **need** you want to fulfil (the problem you want to resolve)
- Your user **target** (or segment)
- The **goal** your target wants to achieve by choosing your product
- Your **differentiator(s)** (what makes your product unique)
- And last but not least, you need to choose a **name** for your product

This is a really important step and it needs to be done seriously to define your core user journey. That's why you'll need to validate your product pitch with a teacher before starting the next challenge.
