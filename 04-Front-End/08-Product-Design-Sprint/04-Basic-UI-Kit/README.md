## Basic UI Kit (30mn)

Congratulations! Now that the user research on your product is done, you are going to start working on the prototype of your application.

But before that, you need to take few minutes to build your **UI Kit**.

An UI Kit is a set of lo-fi components you need to create. It will help you to implement quickly each screen of your wireframes, and it will also help you to keep consistency between all the screens.

To create the UI Kit and your prototype we'll use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Sign up on it and then you'll be able to create your project (you can work directly in your browser or download the desktop app [here](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)).

> You are going to work as a team on figma. Only one of you should create the figma project and then invite the rest of the team as collaborators.

### Create the UI Kit

To create your UI Kit, create a new page called UI Kit and then create a frame to have an idea of the device screen size (it will help you create components that aren't too big or too small).

> We advise you to work together for the UI Kit creation. It will be easier to split the work between teammates when the UI Kit is created.
