## Basic UI Kit (30mn)

Congratulations! Now that the user research on your product is done, you are going to start working on the prototype of your application.

But before that, you need to take few minutes to build your **UI Kit**.

An UI Kit is a set of lo-fi components you need to create. It will help you to implement quickly each screen of your wireframes, and it will also help you to keep consistency between all the screens.

To create the UI Kit and your prototype we'll use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Sign up on it and then you'll be able to create your project (you can work directly in your browser or download the desktop app [here](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)).

> You are going to work as a team on figma. Only one of you should create the figma project and then invite the rest of the team as collaborators.<br>You can follow the steps describe [on this notion page](https://www.notion.so/Give-edit-access-to-a-Figma-file-e6a2a3d9dce342a7b824e0f71cde9035) to create your collaborative project.

### Create the UI Kit

To create your UI Kit, create a new page called UI Kit and then create a frame to have an idea of the device screen size (it will help you create components that aren't too big or too small).

> We advise you to work together for the UI Kit creation. It will be easier to split the work between teammates when the UI Kit is created.

### Create a grayscale palet

As you will build a lo-fi UI Kit, you'll not use colors to create your component.

But at some point it could be handy to have access to a **grayscale palet** to add some contrast in your component.

Create 5 square in your UI Kit to implement it. Each one of this square should have the following background color:

- `#000000` (black)
- `#666666` (dark grey)
- `#999999` (grey)
- `#B8B8B8` (light grey)
- `#ffffff` (white)

This will be the uniq color allowed for your lo-fi components.

### Create your first component

Now it's time to create your first component. Let's begin with an easy one, **the main title**.

Select the text tool, and create a title with a size of `48px` in `bold`. When it's done, don't forget to click to the **create component** button on the top of your workspace. It's really import to do that, if you forgot about it you will not find this component in the assets tab during the wireframe creation.

Here is a example of what you have to do:

### Create all the basic components

Now that you have created your first component, let's complete your UI Kit.

Here is the list of component you should have in your UI Kit before moving to the next challenge.

- A main title (you already did this one)
- A secondary title
- A paragraph
- A link
- A button
- An input

The 3 last components will be a more bit complexe to create than the first one. You will need to group several item together. To to that, start by select each items, then right click on selected item an choose `Group selection` (you can also press `cmd` or `ctrl` + `g`).

Here is an example of doing it for the button creation:
