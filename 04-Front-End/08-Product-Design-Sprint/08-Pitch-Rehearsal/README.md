## Pitch Rehearsal (30mn)

Time to prepare your pitch! In few minutes you will present the prototype you created on front of the class. Here some advice for your presentation:

- **Take the role of a user**: this is the most efficient way to present your product. Start by exposing your problem as a user and explain how the app can help resolve it.
- **Keep it short**: 4 minutes should be enough to present your core user journey
- **Avoid technical vocabulary**: we want to focus on the user experience, so you should avoid using technical vocabulary and speaking about future features.
- **Repeat again and again**: more you will repeat, more you will be confortable and more you presentation will be understandable

Good luck!
